The **Mahabharata** is the longest known epic poem and has been described as "the longest poem ever written". Its longest version consists of over 100,000 shloka or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. **W. J. Johnson** has compared the importance of the Mahabharata in the context of world civilization to that of the **Bible**, the works of **Shakespeare**, the works of **Homer**, **Greek drama**, or the **Qur'an**.
